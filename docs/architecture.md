EDI Claims Processing System Architecture
Overview
The EDI Claims Processing System is a high-performance healthcare claims validation system that combines machine learning predictions with rule-based processing to validate medical claims efficiently.
System Components
1. Data Layer

PostgreSQL Database: Stores claims, diagnoses, procedures, and validation rules
SQL Server Database: Stores validation results and processing metrics
Connection Pooling: Thread-safe database connections with automatic retry logic

2. Processing Engine

Claim Parser: Efficiently parses and chunks claims data for parallel processing
Claim Validator: Hybrid ML + rule-based validation engine
Storage Manager: Optimized bulk storage of validation results

3. Machine Learning Components

Filter Predictor: XGBoost model that predicts applicable validation filters
Rule Generator: Association rule mining for automatic filter discovery
Model Training: Automated retraining pipeline with class balancing

4. Rule Engine

pyDatalog Integration: Logic programming for complex validation rules
Dynamic Rule Loading: Runtime rule updates without system restart
Rule Performance Metrics: Support, confidence, and lift tracking

5. Monitoring & Operations

Prometheus Metrics: Real-time performance and health metrics
Email Notifications: Automated alerts for errors and completion
Resource Optimization: Dynamic memory and CPU management
Structured Logging: PHI-safe logging with JSON formatting

Data Flow

Data Ingestion: Claims loaded via CSV, JSON, or database import
Chunked Processing: Claims divided into parallel processing chunks
ML Prediction: XGBoost model predicts applicable validation filters
Rule Validation: pyDatalog rules validate claims against predicted filters
Result Storage: Validation results stored in SQL Server with bulk operations
Monitoring: Metrics collected and alerts sent for anomalies

Scalability Features

Parallel Processing: Multi-threaded claim processing with configurable workers
Memory Management: Automatic garbage collection and resource monitoring
Database Optimization: Connection pooling and bulk operations
Chunked Processing: Configurable chunk sizes based on system resources

Security Features

Configuration Encryption: Sensitive values encrypted with Fernet encryption
PHI Safety: Automatic sanitization of protected health information in logs
Database Security: Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
Connection Security: Encrypted database connections
